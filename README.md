# Andrew Raikh - Personal Website backed by Qwik üöÄ

This project is using Qwik with [QwikCity](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/overview/). QwikCity is just an extra set of tools on top of Qwik to make it easier to build a full site, including directory-based routing, layouts, and more.

## Motivation

As an engineer, I am in a constant quest for new knowledge, and Qwik has piqued my interest in particular. This is because Resumability, which is at the core of Qwik, is a concept that I have had in mind for many years. Now, I have had the opportunity to experience and interact with it in practice.

Kudos to the [Qwik team](https://github.com/BuilderIO) for making this possible!
